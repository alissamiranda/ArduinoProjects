// Price Calculator & Evaluator
//Using PyCharm IDE 

# Step 1: Creating the list of items and their prices
my_list = ['LED', 1.50, 'Switch', 5, 'Resistor', 0.75, 'Motor', 45, 'Battery', 120]
print("Original List:", my_list)

# Step 2: Function to calculate total cost
def calculate_total_cost(item_list):
    total_cost = 0
    i = 1  # Start at index 1 (which is the first price)

    while i < len(item_list):
        total_cost += item_list[i]  # Add the price to the total cost
        i += 2  # Skip the item name and move to the next price index

    return total_cost

# Step 3: Function to print the cost message
def print_cost_message(total_cost):
    if total_cost > 150:
        print("The cost is too high")
    elif total_cost > 50:
        print("The price is reasonable")
    else:
        print("The price is too low, check the costing again")

# Calculating total cost
total = calculate_total_cost(my_list)
print("Total cost:", total)
# Printing the appropriate message based on the total cost
print_cost_message(total)
